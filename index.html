<p>silentdinner is a $5-per-person 2-person-per-night dinner in silence.</p>
<p>I am a performance artist, but this isn’t a performance. Come to my home, eat the food I’ve cooked, and leave.</p>
<p>Your stated dietary restrictions will be accommodated, but you will not be told what the meal is until you show up.</p>
<p>Dinners take place Monday through Thursday 10pm.</p>
